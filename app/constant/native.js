They also have better access to native UI components and can provide more advanced, platform-specific functionality."
    },
    {
        "question": "When would you use ScrollView over FlatList or vice-versa?",
        "answer": "Use `ScrollView` when you need to display a small number of items that do not require optimization for memory usage, such as when the list's content is known to be small and static. Use `FlatList` when rendering a large or dynamic list of items, as it is optimized for performance by only rendering the items that are currently visible on the screen."
    },
    {
        "question": "Tell us some options of storing persisting data in a React Native app?",
        "answer": "In React Native, you can use options like `AsyncStorage`, `SQLite`, `Realm`, `WatermelonDB`, and `React Native MMKV` for persisting data. `AsyncStorage` is commonly used for storing simple key-value pairs, while databases like `SQLite` and `Realm` are used for more complex data storage needs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is JSX?",
        "answer": "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React and React Native. It allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript, which is then compiled into regular JavaScript function calls that render the user interface. JSX makes it easier to visualize and structure the components in a declarative manner."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is React Native different from ReactJS?",
        "answer": "React Native is a framework for building mobile applications for iOS and Android, while ReactJS is a library used for building web applications. React Native uses native components (e.g., `View`, `Text`, `Image`), while ReactJS uses HTML elements (e.g., `div`, `span`, `img`) for rendering the UI. React Native compiles down to native code, while ReactJS runs in a web browser."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are props in React Native?",
        "answer": "Props (short for properties) in React Native are read-only inputs passed to components from their parent. They allow components to receive dynamic data and configuration from the parent and use that data to render content or influence behavior. Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed by the child component."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the use of FlatList?",
        "answer": "`FlatList` is a component in React Native used for rendering large lists of data in an optimized way.

Flexbox simplifies complex layout tasks by offering properties like `justifyContent`, `alignItems`, and `flexDirection`."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are props and state different?",
        "answer": "Props (short for properties) are immutable inputs passed to a component from its parent, while state is mutable data managed within the component itself. Props are used to pass data down the component tree, whereas state holds data that may change over time and is used to trigger re-renders of the component."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does TouchableHighlight do and when do you use it?",
        "answer": "`TouchableHighlight` is a component in React Native that responds to touch events and provides feedback by highlighting the component when pressed. It is used to create interactive elements like buttons or clickable areas, especially when you want to change the appearance (e.g., change opacity or background color) when the user touches the component."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is State in React Native?",
        "answer": "State in React Native is a mutable object that holds data or information that may change over time. It is used to store values that affect how a component behaves and renders. State can be updated using `setState()` and triggers a re-render of the component whenever it changes."

        "answer": "'Fast Refresh' is a feature in React Native that allows developers to see changes in the app instantly while preserving the component's state. It enables quick iterations during development by reloading only the modified components, resulting in a smoother and faster development experience compared to traditional reloading."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is flex dimension and how is it different from fixed dimension?",
        "answer": "A flex dimension in React Native refers to a layout property where the size of an element is determined by the available space and its relationship with other elements, using Flexbox. Fixed dimensions, on the other hand, have a set value (like pixels or a fixed percentage) for width and height, which does not change based on the container's size or other elements."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you style a component in React Native?",
        "answer": "In React Native, you style components using the `StyleSheet.create()` method to define styles in a JavaScript object. You can then apply these styles to components using the `style` prop. Inline styles are also possible, but using `StyleSheet.create()` is more efficient and helps improve performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you perform logging in React Native?",
        "answer": "In React Native, logging can be performed using the `console.log()` function, just like in JavaScript. This is typically used to print debug information, variables, or messages to the console during development. You can also use third-party libraries like `react-native-debugger` for more advanced logging and debugging features."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some features of Fast Refresh?",
        "answer": "Some features of Fast Refresh include preserving the component state, allowing for real-time feedback during code changes, automatic component reloading on code modifications, and supporting both function and class components. It improves the developer experience by minimizing reload time and reducing UI glitches."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is AppRegistry? Why is it required early in the 'require' sequence?",
        "answer": "AppRegistry in React Native is the entry point for running an app. It registers the root component of the application and is required early in the 'require' sequence because it ensures that the app starts correctly by linking the JavaScript code to the native environment. It is essential for the app's lifecycle to function properly on both iOS and Android platforms."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does StyleSheet.create do and why is it useful?",
        "answer": "`StyleSheet.create` in React Native is used to define a set of styles in a structured way. It returns an object that contains the styles, which can then be applied to components. It is useful because it optimizes the performance of the app by ensuring that styles are processed once and not recreated on each render, leading to faster rendering and better memory usage."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you re-render a FlatList?",
        "answer": "To re-render a `FlatList`, you can modify the data it is displaying (e.g., by changing the data array or adding/removing items) and pass the updated data to the `FlatList` through the `data` prop. You can also use the `extraData` prop to trigger re-renders when non-data-related changes occur, such as changes in state or props."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is flexbox different in React Native and the browser?",
        "answer": "While Flexbox works similarly in React Native and the browser, the key difference is in how they handle certain layout scenarios. In React Native, Flexbox is used to build responsive mobile UIs and supports properties like `flex`, `justifyContent`, and `alignItems`. However, in the browser, Flexbox is used to manage layouts on web pages and might have some differences in behavior due to CSS quirks, such as browser-specific rendering and styling rules."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if you edit modules with exports that are not React components in Fast Refresh?",
        "answer": "In Fast Refresh, if you edit modules that export non-React components, such as plain JavaScript functions or utility modules, the changes will be applied without affecting the rest of the app. Fast Refresh will reload the modified module without disrupting the app's state, ensuring that the new code is used without requiring a full app reload."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the use of ScrollView component?",
        "answer": "The `ScrollView` component in React Native is used to create scrollable areas within an app. It is useful for displaying content that exceeds the screen size, allowing users to scroll vertically or horizontally. `ScrollView` is typically used when the content is dynamic or has a fixed height but needs to be scrollable."
    },
    {
        "question": "In Fast Refresh, what will happen if you edit files imported by modules outside of the React tree?",
        "answer": "In Fast Refresh, if you edit files that are imported by modules outside of the React tree, such as utility modules or non-UI-related code, only the affected modules will be updated without triggering a full reload of the React components. This helps maintain the current app state while ensuring that non-UI changes are reflected in the app without re-rendering the entire UI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some best practices to consider for an action?",
        "answer": "Some best practices for actions include making actions pure functions (not modifying state directly), giving meaningful names to actions, maintaining consistency in action types, and using action creators to avoid hardcoding strings. Additionally, keep actions simple and focused, with one action per function, and handle asynchronous actions using middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is Lifting State Up?",
        "answer": "Lifting State Up is a pattern in React where state is moved from a child component to its parent so that multiple child components can share and update the state. This allows for centralized management of state and ensures that different parts of the application can communicate or react to changes in a unified way."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if you edit a module that only exports React components in Fast Refresh?",
        "answer": "If you edit a module that only exports React components in Fast Refresh, the module will be updated, and the changes will be reflected in the app without a full reload. The state of the component will be preserved, and only the modified component will be re-rendered, ensuring a faster development process."
