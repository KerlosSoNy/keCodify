        - Easy integration with Express or other Node.js servers
        - Customizable configurations for Babel and Webpack`
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain the concept of Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) in Next.js and how it improves performance and SEO.",
        "answer": "Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) in Next.js allows you to update static content after the site has been built and deployed. ISR enables pages to be statically generated at runtime by setting a `revalidate` property in `getStaticProps`, allowing you to specify the time interval after which a page is regenerated. This improves performance by serving cached pages and SEO by ensuring search engines always index the most up-to-date content without the need for rebuilding the entire site. ISR allows a balance between static generation and dynamic updates."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the benefits of using TypeScript with Next.js, and how do you configure it?",
        "answer": "TypeScript with Next.js provides benefits such as static type checking, better development experience with autocompletion, and easier debugging. It helps catch errors at compile time, improving code quality and maintainability. To configure TypeScript in a Next.js project, simply install the necessary TypeScript dependencies (`typescript`, `@types/react`, `@types/node`), and Next.js will automatically detect and generate the `tsconfig.json` file. TypeScript can be used with both server-side and client-side code, offering type safety throughout the application."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Next.js handle routing?",
        "answer": "Next.js uses a file-based routing system. The structure of the pages in the 'pages' directory automatically maps to corresponding routes in the app, simplifying routing without additional configuration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is server-side rendering in Next.js, and how is it implemented in Next.js?",
        "answer": "SSR generates HTML on the server for each request, improving SEO and initial load times. In Next.js, SSR is implemented using the getServerSideProps function, which runs on the server for each request."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Next.js handle CSS, and what are the different options for styling a Next.js application?",
        "answer": "Next.js supports several styling options: global CSS files, CSS modules, styled-components, and inline styles. Global CSS can be applied by importing `.css` files in `_app.js` or `pages/_document.js`. CSS modules allow scoping styles locally to components by using file names with the `.module.css` suffix. Styled-components is a CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS directly within your JavaScript code, with automatic scoping. Additionally, Next.js supports the use of SASS/SCSS by installing the necessary packages. Inline styles are also an option, though they don’t support features like pseudo-classes and media queries."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is static site generation (SSG) in Next.js?",
        "answer": "Static Site Generation (SSG) in Next.js allows you to pre-render pages at build time. This means that the content is generated once during the build process and served as static HTML, improving performance and SEO."
    },
    {
        "question":"What is the difference between Link and regular HTML <a> tags in Next.js?",
        "answer":"The Link component enables client-side navigation with prefetching for faster page transitions, while <a> performs a full-page reload."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you manage environment variables in Next.js, and what are the best practices?",
        "answer": "In Next.js, environment variables are managed through `.env` files, which can be specific to different environments (e.g., `.env.local`, `.env.production`). Variables defined in these files are accessible in the application via `process.env.<VARIABLE_NAME>`. For client-side access, variables must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, making them publicly available in the frontend. Best practices include keeping sensitive data, like API keys, only on the server side and avoiding exposing them to the client. Also, ensure that environment variables are set up for each deployment environment (development, staging, production)."
    },
    {
        "question":"How can you prefetch data in Next.js?",
        "answer":"Data is prefetched automatically with the Link component. For manual prefetching, use router.prefetch()."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Next.js handle automatic code splitting?",
        "answer": "Next.js automatically splits code by creating separate bundles for each page of the app. This allows only the necessary code to be loaded when a page is requested, improving load times and performance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of 'getStaticProps' in Next.js?",
        "answer": "'getStaticProps' is a Next.js function that allows you to fetch data at build time for static pages. It helps in pre-rendering pages with dynamic data, improving performance and SEO."
    }, 
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of `getServerSideProps` in Next.js, and how does it differ from `getStaticProps`?",
        "answer": "`getServerSideProps` is used in Next.js to fetch data on the server for every request, meaning it runs on every page load. It is ideal for dynamic data that needs to be fetched on each request, such as user-specific information or frequently changing data. In contrast, `getStaticProps` runs at build time and generates static content, making it faster and more suitable for static content that doesn’t need to change frequently. `getServerSideProps` is used when you need real-time data, while `getStaticProps` is used when data is static or updated at build time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of `next/head` in Next.js, and how would you use it to manage SEO and metadata?",
        "answer": "`next/head` is a component in Next.js that allows you to manage the contents of the `<head>` tag of a page, such as setting the page title, meta tags, and other SEO-related elements. It is crucial for managing SEO and improving visibility in search engines. You can dynamically modify the head tag for each page using `<Head>` to define things like the title, description, and open graph meta tags. This ensures that search engines index relevant metadata for each page of your site, improving SEO and social media sharing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between `next/image` and using a regular `<img>` tag in Next.js?",
        "answer": "`next/image` is a built-in Next.js component that provides automatic optimization for images, including lazy loading, responsive image sizes, and image format switching (like WebP) based on the user's device. This results in better performance by reducing page load time. The regular `<img>` tag does not provide these optimizations out of the box and requires manual configuration for responsive images, lazy loading, and format switching. `next/image` also provides better SEO performance by automatically serving images with optimized dimensions and improved accessibility."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of `next/link` and how does it optimize routing in Next.js?",
        "answer": "`next/link` is a built-in Next.js component used for client-side navigation between pages within a Next.js application. It optimizes routing by preloading linked pages in the background when they are near the viewport, reducing page load time and improving user experience. Unlike the traditional `<a>` tag in HTML, `next/link` ensures that page transitions are handled using the client-side JavaScript, enabling faster navigation and avoiding full page reloads. Additionally, `next/link` provides support for dynamic routing, query parameters, and more advanced URL handling."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I use custom Babel and Webpack configurations in Next.js?",
        "answer": "Yes, Next.js allows you to customize Babel and Webpack configurations. You can modify these configurations to suit your project's specific needs by editing the next.config.js file."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of `getInitialProps` in Next.js, and how does it differ from `getServerSideProps`?",
        "answer": "`getInitialProps` is a Next.js data fetching method that was used in older versions of Next.js to fetch data on the server side before rendering a page. It runs on both the server and the client and can be used to fetch data before the page is initially rendered. However, `getServerSideProps` is preferred over `getInitialProps` in modern Next.js applications because it only runs on the server-side and does not execute client-side. `getServerSideProps` also supports better optimizations and is more suited for handling dynamic data in modern Next.js projects."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you configure custom webpack in Next.js, and why would you need to do this?",
        "answer": "In Next.js, you can customize the Webpack configuration by modifying the `next.config.js` file. You can extend the default configuration by using the `webpack` field inside `next.config.js`, where you can add loaders, plugins, or other configuration settings. Custom webpack configuration may be needed for adding specific processing rules for assets, integrating third-party libraries that require custom bundling, or optimizing performance. However, it is important to note that Next.js comes with a set of sensible defaults, and customization should be done only when necessary to avoid conflicts."
    },  
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between static generation and server-side rendering in Next.js?",
        "answer": "Static Generation pre-renders pages at build time, and the content is served as static HTML. Server-side rendering (SSR) generates the content on the server for each request, ensuring up-to-date data on every request."
    },
    {
        "question":"What are the differences between using a custom server and the default server in Next.js?",
        "answer":"A custom server provides fine-grained control over requests but requires more configuration and can complicate deployments. The default server is optimized for most use cases."
    },
    {
        "question":"Explain the use case of React Server Components (RSC) in Next.js.",
        "answer":"RSC allows rendering React components on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving performance for complex UI."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Next.js handle static assets, and what are the best practices for serving images, fonts, and other media?",
        "answer": "Next.js handles static assets by serving them from the `public` directory, where any file placed inside this folder is served directly at the root of the website (e.g., `/images/logo.png`). For images, Next.js provides the `next/image` component, which automatically optimizes images by serving them in modern formats, resizing, and lazy loading them for improved performance. For fonts and other static media, it is recommended to use the `next/font` module for font optimization and to keep the media files in the `public` directory or import them using Webpack for bundling and optimization."
    },
    {
        "question":"What are Edge Functions, and how are they used in Next.js?",
        "answer":"Edge Functions run at the CDN edge, enabling low-latency responses for tasks like A/B testing or geolocation-based content."
    },
    {
        "question":"Describe how you would implement authentication in a Next.js application.",
        "answer":"Use API routes for authentication logic, secure cookies or JWT for session management, and middleware for route protection."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can you implement authorization in a Next.js application?",
        "answer": "Authorization in Next.js can be implemented by first managing authentication (e.g., using JWT tokens, OAuth, or third-party services like Auth0) to verify the user's identity. Once authenticated, you can store user data (e.g., in cookies or JWT tokens) and manage user sessions using server-side methods like `getServerSideProps` to verify access to certain pages or API routes. On the client side, you can use React context or state management to track the user's authorization status. For page-level authorization, you can protect specific pages or routes by redirecting unauthorized users to a login page. For example, in `getServerSideProps`, you can check the user's session or token and return a `redirect` object if the user is not authorized."
    },
    {
        "question": "Explain the concept of API routes in Next.js and how they differ from traditional backend APIs.",
        "answer": "API routes in Next.js allow you to build server-side logic directly within the Next.js application without the need for an external backend. Each file in the `pages/api` directory automatically becomes an endpoint, and the exported function handles the HTTP request and response. This differs from traditional backend APIs, where you typically need a separate server (like Express.js or NestJS) to manage API routes. Next.js API routes are fully integrated with the application and provide a simple, serverless way to handle API requests within the same framework."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the concept of 'middleware' in Next.js and how can it be used?",
        "answer": "Middleware in Next.js refers to code that runs before a request is completed, allowing you to add custom logic before the page is rendered. It allows for functionality like authentication checks, redirects, logging, and more. Middleware in Next.js can be defined in a special `_middleware.js` file at any directory level (e.g., in `pages/api` for API routes or in the `pages` directory). Middleware runs before the page is loaded or API routes are called, providing a powerful tool for handling things like authentication and authorization without needing to modify each page or route."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of `next/export` in Next.js, and when would you use it?",
        "answer": "`next/export` is a feature in Next.js that allows you to export your Next.js app as a fully static website. This can be useful when you want to deploy your app to a static hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel in a non-dynamic way. When you run `next export`, Next.js generates a static version of your app with HTML files for every route, ensuring that the entire app can be served as a static site. You would use `next/export` if you have an app that doesn't need server-side rendering or API routes and can be pre-rendered completely at build time."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of `next/dynamic` in Next.js, and how does it help with performance optimization?",
        "answer": "`next/dynamic` is a Next.js feature that allows you to dynamically import components, enabling lazy loading. By dynamically importing components, you reduce the initial JavaScript bundle size, improving the performance and load time of your app. This is particularly useful for components that are not immediately necessary, such as modals, charts, or large UI components that can be loaded only when required. It also supports server-side rendering (SSR) and the ability to use `loading` components while the dynamically imported component is being fetched."
    },
    {
        "question":"How does Next.js handle fallback pages for dynamic routes?",
        "answer":"Fallback pages display a loading state until the dynamic content is fetched. It’s controlled using the fallback property in getStaticPaths."
    },
    {
        "question":"How would you optimize a Next.js application with a large number of dynamic pages?",
        "answer":"Use ISR to regenerate pages as needed, define efficient paths in getStaticPaths, and cache API responses."
    },
    {
        "question":"What steps would you take to migrate a React app to Next.js?",
        "answer":"Replace the routing system with file-based routing, implement SSR/SSG where needed, and configure API routes for backend logic."
    },
    {
        "question":"How would you handle error pages in Next.js (e.g., 404 or 500 errors)?",
        "answer":"Customize error pages by creating 404.js and 500.js in the pages directory. Use ErrorBoundary components for handling runtime errors."
    },
    {
        "question":"How do you implement a multi-language (i18n) application in Next.js?",
        "answer":"Use the built-in internationalization (i18n) feature in next.config.js or libraries like next-i18next for language detection, translation files, and routing."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the security considerations when deploying a Next.js application, and how can you mitigate potential risks?",
        "answer": "When deploying a Next.js application, it's important to consider security risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and server-side vulnerabilities. To mitigate these risks, you should sanitize and validate user inputs, ensure that sensitive information like API keys is stored in environment variables, and never expose them to the client. Use secure HTTP headers such as `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `X-Frame-Options` to prevent XSS and clickjacking attacks. Additionally, consider using HTTPS for all communications and implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for protected routes. Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or Dependabot."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you handle large-scale applications with Next.js, especially when dealing with multiple teams and micro-frontends?",
        "answer": "Handling large-scale applications with Next.js can be done effectively by using a modular approach, splitting the app into smaller, manageable pieces (micro-frontends). Each micro-frontend can be developed and deployed independently by different teams, improving scalability and reducing the complexity of the overall system. In Next.js, you can leverage features like dynamic imports, API routes, and incremental static regeneration (ISR) to keep parts of the application independent and performant. Additionally, managing the application with a monorepo using tools like Nx or Lerna can simplify dependency management and improve collaboration between multiple teams working on the same codebase."
